    <h2>1. Difference between “ == “ and “ === “ operators.</h2>
    <p><b>ANS.</b> "==" and "===" both comes under relational operator.</p>
    <p> "==" :The == operator means "is equal to," matching by value only.</p>
    <p> "===":The === operator means "is exactly equal to," matching by both value and data type.</p>
    <h2>2. What is the spread operator?</h2>
    <p><b>ANS.</b> The JavaScript spread operator is denoted like this (...) and
        used to expand or iterables which is introduced in 2015 Es6.
        it allows us to quickly copy all or part of an existing array or object into another array or object.
        used to expand or iterables which is introduced in 2015 Es6.</p>
    <pre>
        const odd = [1,3,5]; 
            const combined = [2,4,6, ...odd];
               console.log(combined); // [ 2, 4, 6, 1, 3, 5 ]
    </pre>
    <h2>3. What are the differences between var, let and const?</h2>
    <b>ANS.</b>
    <table border="3px">
        <tr>
            <th>VAR</th>
            <th>LET</th>
            <th>CONST</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>we can declare the variable name in one line and initalize it on another line</th>
            <th>we can declare the variable name in one line and initalize it on another line(or)in the same line itself
            </th>
            <th>we can declare the variable and initalize in the same line itself </th>
        </tr>
        <tr>

    <h2>4&5. What is execution context</h2>
    <p><b>ANS.</b> The creation of <b>"Execution Context"</b>happens in two phases.They are:
    <ol>
        <li>Creation Phase.</li>
        <li>Execution Phase.</li>
    </ol>
    <center>
        <table border="3px">
            <tr>
                <th>Creation Phase</th>
                <th>Execution Phase</th>

            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Memory is allocated</td>
                <td> Execution of code starts</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>It is also called "Variable Environment".</td>
                <td>It is also called "Thread of Execution".</td>
            </tr>

        </table>
    </center>
    <ul>
        <li>When memory is allocates what does it stores means a special value called "undefined"</li>
        <li>Once code execution starts the "undefined" is updated with the value assigned to the Variable.</li>
        <li>In case of functions it literally stores whole code of the function inside memory space,
            Once it starts to execute another execution context is created inside the global execution context.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>6. What is meant by first class functions</h2>
    <p><b>ANS.</b> It is also called as first class citizen First-Class Function: A programming language is said to have
        First-class functions.
        If functions in that language are treated like other variables.
        So the functions can be assigned to any other variable or passed as an argument or can be returned by another
        function.
    </p>
    <h2>7. What are closures? Give an example of closure</h2>
    <p><b>ANS.</b>A closure is a function that references variables in the outer scope from its inner scope. The closure
        preserves the outer scope inside its inner scope.
        Lexical scoping defines the scope of a variable by the position of that variable declared in the source code.
    </p>
    <pre>
    var name = "John";

    function greeting() {
      var message = "Hi";
      console.log(message);
      
    }
       greeting()    //Hi
</pre>
    <ul type="dash">
        <li>The variable "name" is a global variable. It is accessible from anywhere including within the greeting()
            function.</li>
        <li>The variable "message" is a local variable that is accessible only within the greeting() function.</li>
        <li>If you try to access the message variable outside the greeting() function, you will get an error.</li>
        <li>So the JavaScript engine uses the scope to manage the variable accessibility.</li>
    </ul>
